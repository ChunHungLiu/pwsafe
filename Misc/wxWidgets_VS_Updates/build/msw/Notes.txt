The file "wxBuild_wxWidgets.bat" in this directory has been updated to compile
V2.8.11 of wxWidgets for VS2010 (Visual C++ complier 10.0), VS2012
(Visual C++ complier 11.0) and for VS2013 (Visual C++ complier 12.0) 32-bit and 64-bit projects.

This file is based on that provided by RJP Computing as part of the wxPack project
(see: http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/).  It has been updated to support VS2010 and VS2012
and also 64-bit compilations for VS2005, VS2008, VS2010 and VS2012.

Note: PasswordSafe wxWidgets uses the static Unicode libraries only, although the
following will also build the Unicode DLLs.

For VS2010, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc100.
For VS2012, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc110.
For VS2013, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc120.

For the 32-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command window in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL DLL_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL DLL_RELEASE_UNICODE

The resulting libraries will be vc10_lib and vc10_dll for VS2010, vc11_lib and vc11_dll for VS2012 and
vc12_lib and vc12_dll for VS2013.

For the 64-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command window in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL DLL_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL DLL_RELEASE_UNICODE

The resulting libraries will be vc10_lib and vc10_dll for VS2010, vc11_lib and vc11_dll for VS2012 and
vc12_lib and vc12_dll for VS2013.

The PasswordSafe VS projects expect the static libraries to be in the wxWidgets sub-directories
\lib\vcxx_lib and \lib64\vcxx_lib for the 32-bit and 64-bit compilations respectively, where the xx
is 10, 11 or 12.  PasswordSafe does not use the DLL libraries and so there is no need to build them
for this project.

VS2005
======

If you continue to use VS2005, you should put the static libraries built by it in \lib\vc8_lib.
